                  I'm a bioengineer turned machine-learning engineer with a passionate curiosity for scientific computing,
                  computer vision, biotech, and music applications.<br><br>

                  My skill-set is at the intersection of data science and software engineering. I work with tools
                  and techniques like Python, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, Google Cloud, C++, unit testing,
                  continuous integration, and automated deployment to create interesting applications that scale.<br><br>

                  On the side, I like experimenting with my own inventive projects, like a robotic microscope which
                  generates gigapixel panoramic photos of tiny things, frequency analysis software which turns audio files
                  into piano visualizations, and a wearable device which creates music from human physiology.<br><br>

                  Overall, I just love building things.

                           <p> Aposynthese is a tool to give anyone perfect pitch. It converts mp3 files into piano visualizations, giving the user
                              the ability to learn any song they like. It works by decomposing the song's underlying constituent frequencies with the
                              Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and mapping dominant frequencies to real piano notes across time. The program also
                              leverages some advanced Music Information Processing techniques, available through the librosa audio processing library. These include
                              Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS) to remove drum beats, and iterative cosine similarity to remove vocals.
                              Additional custom signal processing cleans up the STFT spectrograms and allows smoother tonality mapping that mimics the human ear.

                           <p> [Work in progress...] Hyperscope is a low-cost robotic microscope for generating hyper-resolution microscope images.
                              It uses 3d printing, easy to find, off-the-shelf components, and open source software to reduce the cost of  the cost of an automated microscope from $10k to less than $100.
                              The hardware and software is designed to automatically scan a slide sample and take photos at predetermined steps. Images are stitched together
                              using a custom algorithm written using OpenCV, and the final gigapixel panormaic is sliced according to the GZI Protocol for rendering in a web browser (like Google Maps).
                              Additionally, manual moving of the step motors is possible via joystick, and imaging via remote shutter release.

                           <p>Insula is the first device to create music from multiple biofeedback sensors. It was built for my bachelor's thesis on a team with 3 other engineers.
                              Our system creates live audio output by processing biodata from EEG, EMG, ECG, and breath rate sensors.
                              Physiological inputs (heart beats, muscle contractions etc.) are mapped to musical outputs (drum beats, chords) for the purpose
                              of meditation, physiotherapy, and artistry. Insula paints a meaningful and holistic picture of bioinformation, enabling users to
                              control and direct their body's natural rhythms into acoustic art.

                              <br><br>I extended the original project with a "V2", which includes a glove with IMU sensor which allows intentional control of the music.

                              <br><br>Our tech-stack includes Arduino, C++, Python, Processing (Java), and OpenBCI.

                              The algorithm uses a recursive Hough Circles to detect well plates, and cells, plus basic image filtering and thresholding.  It significantly improved both quality and speed of identifications.

                              to tease out the frequency of the heart rate based on the changing redness of skin during a heart contraction.
