## Personal Projects:

#### [Unet for Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/momonala/semantic_segmentation_cars)

Developed a Unet for semantic segmentation of cars on the road from a dashcam image. Implemented the original architecture from the Unet paper on arXiv. Trained several iterations on a GPU, including ones for gradient checks, a control baseline, and augmentation/regularization. FCN model to come. 

#### [Deep Tesla](https://github.com/momonala/deeptesla)

Developed a behavioral cloning algorithm to predict steering angle commands from dashcam images. Additionally, I tested the efficacy of using Singlar Value Decomposition as a preprocessing step for background removal of stationary objects in the frame (dashboard, reflections etc). Used MIT's Deep Tesla dataset. 

#### [Insula](https://github.com/momonala/Insula-V2) (see V2)

A continuation of my senior thesis project - this time using a haptic glove to give more intentional control to the physiological based music. Built all hardware and software myself this time, using Arduino, Python, ChucK, and the awesome HSC Electronics store in Sunnyvale :)

#### [Quantitative Finance](https://github.com/momonala/quantitative_finance)

I Built a novel algorithm using adaptive Bollinger Bars to predict stock prices. Back tested across 900 tickers and 12+ years of stock data from Quandl.

#### [Optical Heart-Rate Detection Via Webcam](https://github.com/momonala/image_processing_projects/tree/master/optical_heart_rate)

This is a real-time computer vision application to measure heart-rate from changes in optical intensity via a webcam. Implementation of MIT paper .

## Udacity Self Driving Car, Deep Learning and Robotics Nanodegree 

#### [Extended & Unscented Kalman Filters](https://github.com/momonala/autonomousVehicle_nanodegree_udacity/tree/master/project7-unscented_kalman_filter)

Created Unscented and Extended Kalman Filters in C++ for sensor fusion/filtering from a lidar & radar data simulator. Utilized the Eigen library. 

#### [Laneline & Vehicle Detection for Autonomous Cars](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_carND_term1/tree/master/project5_vehicle_detection)

Used a combination of traditional and machine learnign based computer vision techniques to track lanelines and cars from dashcam camera. Techniques include HOG feature extraction, PCA dimensionality reduction, and an ensemble of ML classifiers.

#### [Traffic Sign Detection](https://github.com/momonala/udacity_carND/tree/master/project2_traffic_sign_classifier)

Built and refined a CNN in Keras for detection of traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign dataset. 

#### [FCN for Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/momonala/robotics_nanodegree_udacity/tree/master/project4_semantic_segmentation)

Created a Fully Convolutional Network in Keras for semantic segmentation of video footage from a drone simulator.

## Work/School Projects 

#### [Cell Colony Counting](https://github.com/momonala/imaging_and_vision/tree/master/cell_counting)

For my work at as an autmation engineer intern at Amyris, a synthetic biology company, I improved the computer vision algorithms for a automated cell-colony-counter robot.

#### [Insula](https://github.com/momonala/Insula-V2) (see V1)  

For my senior thesis project, I worked in a team of four to create a unique bioedical device, Insula. Insula is a suite of biosensors - EEG, EMG, ECG, and breath rate - that convert physiologyical events, like a heart-beat, into a musical events, like drum beat. The idea is to use technology to look inwards, as a form of meditation and music therapy.

#### [Data Science on US Visa Applications](https://github.com/momonala/machine_learning_projects/tree/master/USVisas_bigData_project)

For my big data course, we analyzed the acceptance rates for various Visa types for the USA. The results were quite interesting. 

#### [Data Science Tutorials](https://github.com/momonala/programming-notes/tree/master/data_science)

For my work as a data science educator at General Assembly, I wrote several tutorials for my students explaining arcane data science topics that were not discussed in class. You can find them here.
